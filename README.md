# 📝 CollabEdit

### Real-time collaborative rich-text editor — Google-Docs-style multiplayer editing, with **no server**.

Type together, see each other's cursors live, and merge every edit conflict-free with CRDTs.
Pure peer-to-peer over WebRTC. Works offline. Deploys to a static host for **$0**.

## Why this is interesting

Real-time collaboration looks simple until two people edit the same word at the same instant — then naïve apps corrupt the document. CollabEdit solves this with a **CRDT** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) via [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs): every keystroke is a commutative operation, so all peers **mathematically converge on the same document** regardless of network ordering, latency, or who typed first. No operational-transform server, no lock, no "someone else is editing" banners.

And there's **no backend to run**. Browsers connect **directly to each other over WebRTC**; a public signaling server is used only to introduce peers (it never sees your content). Everything else — merging, presence, persistence — happens client-side.

## Features

- ✍️ **Full rich-text editing** — headings, bold/italic/underline/strike, inline code, ordered/bulleted/task lists, blockquotes, code blocks, links, and dividers (Tiptap / ProseMirror).
- 👥 **Live multiplayer cursors** — see every collaborator's caret and name, colour-coded, moving in real time.
- 🟢 **Presence** — stacked avatars show who's in the room; a status pill shows live / waiting / offline.
- 🔗 **Shareable rooms** — the room id lives in the URL hash, so collaborating is just sharing a link. No accounts.
- 💾 **Offline-first** — the document persists to IndexedDB; edit with no connection and it syncs automatically when peers reconnect.
- ↩️ **CRDT-aware undo/redo** — undo only reverts *your* changes, even amid concurrent edits.
- 🎨 **Identity** — pick your display name and cursor colour; persisted across sessions.
- 🌗 **Light / dark theme**, live word & character counts, fully keyboard-accessible toolbar.
- ⚡ **Tiny app shell** (~7 kB gzip) on top of the editor vendor chunk.

| Layer | Library | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| Editor | `@tiptap/react` + ProseMirror | Rich-text view & schema |
| CRDT | `yjs` | Conflict-free shared document |
| Transport | `y-webrtc` | Peer-to-peer sync + presence (awareness) |
| Persistence | `y-indexeddb` | Local-first offline storage |
| Cursors | `@tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor` | Remote carets & labels |

The binding lives in [`src/collab/`](src/collab): `useCollaboration.ts` owns the document/provider/persistence lifecycle, and `useDocEditor.ts` attaches Tiptap to the shared `Y.Doc` (with StarterKit's history disabled in favour of the CRDT undo manager).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

Open the URL, then **open the same link in a second tab or browser** — start typing and watch them sync. (Tabs in one browser sync instantly via BroadcastChannel; across devices it uses WebRTC.)

## Verify it really works

A Playwright test drives two independent peers in one room and asserts the document converges in both directions:

```bash
npm run build
npm run verify
```

```
✓ Body synced to second peer
✓ Title synced to second peer
✓ Reverse sync confirmed (bidirectional CRDT merge)
✓ Remote collaborator cursor rendered
VERIFICATION PASSED — real-time collaboration works end to end.
```

## Deploy

Static output — host anywhere. For Vercel:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel            # or: connect the GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard
```

`vercel.json` is preconfigured (Vite framework, hashed-asset caching). No environment variables, no server.

## A note on signaling

Peer discovery uses public Yjs signaling servers (listed in `useCollaboration.ts`). They only broker the WebRTC handshake — **document content is always exchanged directly between browsers and is never sent to them.** For production traffic you can self-host a signaling server (`npx y-webrtc-signaling`) and swap the URLs.
